HOME DEFAULT="/home/@{PAM_USER}"

# For some reason this gets executed twice,
# but removing this line means ~/.local/bin isn't added at all.

# Moreover, GDM fails to export only this variable from ~/.config/environment.d,
# meaning all Wayland sessions fail to see it.
# https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdm/-/issues/385

# On Wayland, the only other place to set global environment variables is
# .pam_environment, except that pam_env now defaults to not loading this file.
# Be sure to re-enable it by adding `user_readenv=1` to the line containing
# `pam_env.so` in /etc/pam.d/system-login.

# However, systemd services only see environment variables set by environment.d,
# so we need this variable duplicated there too.

# All these issues mean PATH likely contains ~/.local/bin three times.
